    <p>I'm interested in math and computer science. I think I'm a logical person therefore I like things 
        that have a correct answer instead of like having a set of standards for the right answer but 
        there isn't one correct answer. My hobbies are gaming and coding which I spent a lot of time on
        to create projects. I also enjoy listening to music, if you by chance saw me on the subway there
        wouldn't be a single time that I'm not wearing my earbuds.
