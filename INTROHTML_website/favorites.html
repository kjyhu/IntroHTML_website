    <p>I'm interested in math and computer science. I'm a logical person therefore I like to solve
        problems that have like an exact answer rather than problems that have a rubric for the answer
        but there isn't one direct answer which I found annoying. I also enjoy listening to music, if you 
        by chance saw me on the subway there wouldn't be a single time that I'm not wearing my earbuds.
